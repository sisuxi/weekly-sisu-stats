### Notes
- Production environment maintains 100+ active flags for various UI features and system controls
- Key production flags include `showSearch`, `hebbiaBanner`, and `bouncerDisabled`
- Sisu created a LaunchDarkly access token on September 5th (outside target week), likely for tooling/automation purposes
