## LaunchDarkly Activity

### Flag Changes
No flag changes during the week of August 24-30, 2025.

### Production Changes
No production changes or deployments during the target week.

### Activity Summary
- **Flag Changes**: 0
- **New Flags Created**: 0  
- **Production Deployments**: 0
- **Sisu Activities**: 0

### Context
The target week showed no LaunchDarkly activity. This could indicate reduced deployment activity during the summer period. Recent activity (September 2025) shows active feature flag management with flags for UI features, system controls, and experimental features.

### Notes
- Production environment maintains 100+ active flags for various UI features and system controls
- Key production flags include `showSearch`, `hebbiaBanner`, and `bouncerDisabled`
- Sisu created a LaunchDarkly access token on September 5th (outside target week), likely for tooling/automation purposes

## Next Week

### Priorities Based on Current Work
- **Performance Initiative**: Complete HEB-1669 observability improvements and continue optimization work on HEB-1668 Matrix slowness
- **Technical Leadership**: Continue supporting team with database optimization strategies and infrastructure deployments
- **Process Improvements**: Follow up on GitHub workflow proposals and interview process standardization
- **Team Collaboration**: Maintain active cross-team technical support and mentorship

### Expected Outcomes
- Resolution of P0 performance issues with measurable improvements
- Enhanced observability for production database operations
- Continued leadership on engineering process improvements
