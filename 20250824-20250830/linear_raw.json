        "description": "Get rows is one of the slowest queries in our product and frequently cause a lot of DB load, some even leading to incidents. To fix this, we must first have more observability into the slowest parts of it.\n\nRight now, the way to diagnose slow queries is to sort them by duration and EXPLAIN ANALYZE each query. We have gotten as much gains as we could from painstakingly doing this - adding indices etc., but it is still very slow, and going further is a bad way to figuring out what's slow.\n\nGet rows is a very complicated query with a lot of parameters - filters, sorts, etc. A lot of these trigger very expensive query patterns like JSONB aggregations and ILIKE filtering. So:\n\n* Want to know: *What query patterns are slowest*?\n\nTask: Let's emit a log-based metric that has context fields:\n\n* sort orders,\n* filters,\n* full matrix search or not,\n* num rows & num cols in matrix,\n* num rows returned,\n* cache hit or miss (in get_relevant_rows())\n* latencies\n\nget_rows() is a 2-phase operation that has the following steps:\n\n1. get_relevant_rows() - based on the filters & pagination settings present, get me the relevant row_ids to return to the frontend\n2. hydrate_rows(): hydrate the row ids with all the cells that belong to the row. This is an expensive JSONB aggregation to fetch all the cells contents for the rows.\n\nWe should have statistics for both so we know which combinations are slow.",
