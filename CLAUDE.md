# Claude Code Context for Weekly Snapshot Reports

## Project Overview
This repository generates comprehensive weekly snapshot reports for Sisu Xi, Principal Software Engineer at Hebbia (highest-level IC in the company). The reports document strategic technical leadership, cross-team impact, and organizational influence.

## Critical Context

### User Role
- **Name**: Sisu Xi
- **Position**: Principal Software Engineer at Hebbia
- **Level**: Highest-level Individual Contributor (IC) in the company
- **GitHub**: `sisuxi` (Hebbia work account)
- **Email**: `sisu@hebbia.ai`
- **Start Date**: August 18, 2025

### Report Purpose
Weekly snapshots serve multiple purposes:
1. Performance documentation for reviews
2. Team visibility into principal-level work
3. Historical record of technical decisions
4. Personal tracking of impact and contributions

## Execution Requirements

### CRITICAL: Use Python Automation
**ALWAYS** use the existing Python scripts for data collection:
- Use `calculate_week.py` for date calculation - NEVER calculate dates manually
- Use `collect_raw_data.py` for ALL data collection - NEVER collect data manually
- Only generate report sections after raw data collection is complete
- Follow the exact workflow in `go.md`

### Folder Structure
Each week gets its own folder: `YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD/`
- Raw data files: `raw_*.json` (collected by Python scripts)
- Section files: `section_*.md` (generated by Claude)
- Final report: `weekly_report.md` (assembled by Claude)

### Automated Folder Handling
The `go.md` workflow automatically:
1. Calculates dates using `calculate_week.py`
2. Removes existing folder completely (`rm -rf`)
3. Collects fresh data using `collect_raw_data.py`
4. Exits if ANY data collection fails

## Report Focus Areas

### Principal Engineer Priorities
- **Strategic Impact**: Architectural decisions, system-wide improvements
- **Technical Leadership**: Mentorship, code reviews, unblocking teams
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Breaking silos, aligning teams
- **Organizational Influence**: Process improvements, standards establishment

### Metrics That Matter
- Architecture reviews conducted
- Engineers mentored/unblocked
- Cross-team initiatives led
- System performance improvements
- Technical debt reduced

## Data Sources

All configured in `~/Hebbia/sisu-tools/`:

1. **GitHub**: PRs, reviews, commits (focus on architectural impact)
   - Uses date ranges for precise filtering
   - Tracks created, reviewed, and involved PRs separately
   
2. **Slack**: Technical discussions, mentorship, incident response
   - Uses `history` command for complete message history (unlimited)
   - Checks 12+ engineering channels for user's messages automatically
   - Rate limiting protection with `--single-channel --channel-delay N` options
   - Filters messages by user identity (Sisu Xi) across all channels
   - Includes direct search validation and activity summaries
   
3. **Gmail**: Strategic communications, decisions
   - Filters by date range for sent/received emails
   
4. **Calendar**: Meeting time, strategic sessions
   - Events within specified date range
   
5. **Drive**: Documentation, technical designs
   - Modified documents within date range
   
6. **Linear**: P0/P1 issues, technical debt, cross-team work
   - Issues assigned/created/completed within date range
   
7. **LaunchDarkly**: Production changes, feature rollouts
   - Feature flag status (limited history support)

## Writing Style

Follow `/Users/sisu/.claude/commands/writing_guideline.md`:
- **Concise**: Remove unnecessary words
- **Clear**: Avoid jargon
- **Objective**: Focus on outcomes
- **Action-oriented**: Use active voice

## Common Gotchas

1. **Never Calculate Dates Manually**: Always use `python3 calculate_week.py`
2. **Never Collect Data Manually**: Always use `python3 collect_raw_data.py`
3. **Executive Summary**: MUST be generated AFTER all data collection
4. **Follow Script Workflow**: Use the exact commands in `go.md`
5. **Error Handling**: Exit immediately if data collection script fails
6. **Clean State**: Scripts automatically handle folder cleanup
7. **Slack Rate Limiting**: Use `--single-channel --channel-delay 2` if needed
8. **Authentication**: Scripts verify GitHub auth as `sisuxi` before collection

## Usage Pattern

```bash
@go.md
```

This will:
1. Calculate previous week's dates (Sunday-Saturday) using `calculate_week.py`
2. Clean existing folder completely (`rm -rf`)
3. Run automated data collection using `collect_raw_data.py`
4. Generate individual sections from raw data files
5. Create final report with executive summary
6. Output location: `YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD/weekly_report.md`

### Files Generated

**Raw Data Files** (created by Python scripts):
- `raw_github.json` - GitHub PRs, reviews, commits
- `raw_slack.json` - Slack messages across engineering channels
- `raw_gmail.json` - Email statistics and important communications
- `raw_calendar.json` - Meeting events and time summaries
- `raw_drive.json` - Document modifications and activities
- `raw_linear.json` - Issues assigned/created/completed
- `raw_launchdarkly.json` - Feature flag information

**Report Sections** (created by Claude from raw data):
- `section_github.md`, `section_slack.md`, etc. - Individual platform sections
- `weekly_report.md` - Final consolidated report

## Key Commands

### Date Calculation
```bash
date +"%Y-%m-%d %A"  # Get current date
# Calculate Sunday-Saturday of previous week
```

### Folder Setup
```bash
mkdir -p YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD  # Create week folder (e.g., 20250824-20250830)
```

### Python Script Usage Examples
```bash
# Standard workflow (follow go.md exactly)
FOLDER=$(python3 calculate_week.py)
rm -rf "$FOLDER"
python3 collect_raw_data.py

# Custom date range
python3 collect_raw_data.py --start 2025-09-01 --end 2025-09-07 --force

# Rate limiting for Slack
python3 collect_raw_data.py --single-channel --channel-delay 2

# Specific channels only
python3 collect_raw_data.py --channels eng ask-eng-leads matrix-team
```
